ðŸŒŸ Project 01: Logo Design for TOMS Shoes ðŸŒŸ
I am excited to share my first project at CodexCue, where I had the opportunity to redesign the logo for TOMS Shoes! TOMS is renowned for their "One for One" business model, which promises to deliver a pair of free shoes to a child in need for every retail product sold.
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Create a unique and memorable logo focusing on simplicity and brand identity principles.
ðŸ”¹ Design Elements:
Brand Colors: Incorporated TOMS' recognizable blue and white palette to maintain brand consistency.
One for One Concept: Highlighted this core value by featuring hanging shoes. In some cultures, hanging shoes symbolize donations, allowing those in need to take them without feeling ashamed.

I'm thrilled with how this design turned out and grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a brand with such a powerful mission.
